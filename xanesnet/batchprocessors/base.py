class BatchProcessor(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for batch processors.

    Converts a dataset batch into model inputs and targets for a specific
    model architecture. Subclasses must implement the data-shaping methods
    :meth:`input_preparation`, :meth:`target_preparation`, and
    :meth:`sample_id_extraction`, plus the three encoding hooks
    :meth:`encode_input`, :meth:`encode_target`, and :meth:`decode_target`.

    **Spectra encoding.** The stored
    :class:`~xanesnet.encodings.SpectraEncoding` is applied to spectra only.
    Whether the spectrum is the model *input* or the model *target* depends on
    the prediction direction, so the encoding is applied through three hooks:

    * :meth:`encode_input` -- map raw model inputs into the space the model
      consumes (encodes the spectral input for inverse prediction).
    * :meth:`encode_target` -- map raw targets into the model's prediction
      space before the loss (encodes the spectral target for forward
      prediction).
    * :meth:`decode_target` -- map predictions (in the model's prediction
      space) back to the raw target space during inference (decodes spectra
      for forward prediction).

    These hooks are abstract here to make the contract explicit. Concrete
    processors normally inherit them from one of the two direction-specific
    parents,
    :class:`~xanesnet.batchprocessors.forward.base.ForwardBatchProcessor`
    (spectra are the target) or
    :class:`~xanesnet.batchprocessors.inverse.base.InverseBatchProcessor`
    (spectra are the input), and only implement the data-shaping methods.

    :meth:`input_preparation` and :meth:`target_preparation` always return
    raw tensors so that inferencers can store ground truth in the original
    space and auto-config can resolve raw dimensions. When ``encoding`` is
    ``None`` (e.g. during auto-config resolution) all encode/decode hooks
    become pass-throughs.

    Args:
        encoding: Optional spectra encoding. When provided, the direction
            parent applies it in its hooks. When ``None``, all encode/decode
            hooks return their inputs unchanged.
