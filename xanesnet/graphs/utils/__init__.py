"""Shared graph-construction utilities used by :class:`GraphBuilder` subclasses.

The functions here operate on already-built edge lists (symmetrisation,
truncation) and on already-built graphs (target-site-centred paths, triplet
angles, and direction-aware higher-order indices). They are model-agnostic
and reused across builders and downstream dataset code.
