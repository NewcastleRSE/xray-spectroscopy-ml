class GraphBuilder(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for all XANESNET graph builders.

    A graph builder converts a pymatgen ``Structure`` or ``Molecule`` into a
    directed edge list with per-edge metadata used by graph neural networks.
    Concrete subclasses implement one edge-construction strategy each and
    register themselves with :data:`GraphBuilderRegistry`.

    All builders return bidirectional graphs: every emitted edge ``(i -> j)``
    has a matching reverse edge ``(j -> i)``, so downstream models can treat
    the returned ``edge_index`` as an undirected graph.

    Args:
        graph_builder_type: Identifier string for the concrete builder type.
        cutoff: Maximum edge length in **angstroms**. The precise meaning is
            method-dependent (hard cutoff for radius/voronoi; hard upper
            bound alongside a covalent-radius test for ``cov_radius``).
        max_num_neighbors: Maximum outgoing edges retained per source node
            (shortest first). Bidirectionality is enforced after this
            truncation.

        Args:
            pmg_obj: The pymatgen object whose atoms are graph nodes.
            compute_vectors: If ``False``, ``edge_vec`` is returned as
                ``None`` to save memory in downstream consumers that do not
                need it. Geometry-aware methods still compute vectors
                internally (they are needed for symmetrisation).

              **angstroms**.
            - ``edge_vec``: ``(E, 3)`` float32 or ``None`` -- displacement
              vectors ``pos[dst] - pos[src]``.
            - ``edge_attr``: ``(E,)`` float32 or ``None`` -- optional
              per-edge scalar (facet area for Voronoi, ``None`` otherwise).
